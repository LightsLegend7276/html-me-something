   <h1>Hawaii 2019 Vacation</h1>
   <div>
      <h2><b>Beaches</b></h2>
      <p>
         While in Hawaii we visited several different beaches throughout the trip. Not only were they different in
         location, but they were also different in attributes. We visited beaches with black sand, red sand and white
         sand. We also visited a beach that had a shoreline of pebbles. Some of these beaches were accessible by car
         with a small hike and some required a very long and steep trek down a mountainside. Needless to say no 2
         beaches were alike and neither were the adventures getting to them.

      <h2>Canoe in the Ocean</h2>
      <p>
         One of the things I thought I'd never catch myself doing in Hawaii was going into the ocean on a canoe. With
         the help of a local guide me and my family did just that. We faced some fears, put our game faces on and canoed
         about a half mile off shore. While on the canoe we heard stories about some of the cities that you could see
         lining the sea shore. Then to our very pleasant surprise we were visited by some creatures of the sea,
         dolphins. More curious than anything they came and checked out what we were doing and then went on about their
         business.

      <h2>Volcano</h2>
      <p>One of the many wonders and attractions of the big island of Hawaii are it's Volcanoes. While many are dormant
         there are a few which are very active. Unfortunately, due to the eruptions from 2018 we were not able to get as
         close as we would have liked, but we were able to trek through a dormant volcanic crater. The hike took roughly
         4 hours to complete. It required a 2 mile hike along the crater wall, then a very steep downhill walk into the
         crater and then a 4 to 5 mile walk inside the crater before ascending the crater wall to the finish.</p>

      <h2>Mountain Views</h2>
      <p>Whether you're approaching by air or boat or on the island in a vehicle going form city to city one undeniable
         feature of the island are it's mountains. During our time on the island we did our best to visit as many known
         mountains, but also found ourselves up some we never intended to be. While the sights were amazing they were
         daunting at the same time. While trying to capture the most amazing views we found ourselves dreading the very
         moment. If you have a fear of heights I recommend getting a very long selfie stick and taking pictures from a
         distance.</p>

      <h2>Waterfalls</h2>
      <p>If there's mountains you will usually find waterfalls. Since our trip was in December, outside of their rain
         season, there weren't many to observe. We did find some waterfalls though and captured their beauty. Some
         cascade and as the wind carries the falling water creates a rainbow. Others are just giant and mighty. Either
         way they are always amazing to look at.</p>
