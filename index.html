      <h2><b>Beaches</b></h2>
      <p>
         While in Hawaii we visited several different beaches throughout the trip. Not only were they different in
         location, but they were also different in attributes. We visited beaches with black sand, red sand and white
         sand. We also visited a beach that had a shoreline of pebbles. Some of these beaches were accessible by car
         with a small hike and some required a very long and steep trek down a mountainside.
